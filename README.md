# INTA6450EnronProject
Final Project for INTA6450

In this project we aim to identify Enron's wrongdoings and create an automated way to identify these wrongdoings based on the Enron Email Corpus dataset

Our project is based on Aly S's approach to email fraud detection, with our own modifications and contributions.
